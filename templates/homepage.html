            A Flask Based Web Application which sends an alert to the user who
            doesn't wear the mask
          </p>
          <p>
            The Captured image is predicted with the help of deep learning model

              The Main Aim Of The Project Is To Detect
              <strong>Whether The Person Is Wearing A Mask Or Not</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              To Predict Whether The Person Is Wearing A Mask Or Not. We Are
              Making Using Of <strong>Deep Learning.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Among Different Neural Networks We Make Use Of
              <strong>MobileNet</strong> As Our Primary Neural Network Model.
            </p>
            <p>
              MobileNet is more reliable for low computing devices. So for
              detection we used MobileNet as the primary network.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Developing Web Application We Made Use Of
              <strong>Flask</strong> as a main framework and front-end
              technologies like <strong>HTML,CSS,JS</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Trained Model is used for predicting the uploaded image or
              image which was live captured or through the live cam detection.
